# Rust Learning Repository

This repository contains my journey of learning Rust programming language. It includes various examples, exercises, and projects that I've created while learning Rust.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version recommended)
- Cargo (comes with Rust installation)

## Building and Running

### Using Cargo

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd rust-playground/project_name
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build
```

3. Run the project:
```bash
cargo run
```

### Additional Cargo Commands

- Check for compilation errors without producing an executable:
```bash
cargo check
```

- Run tests:
```bash
cargo test
```

- Build in release mode (optimized):
```bash
cargo build --release
```
